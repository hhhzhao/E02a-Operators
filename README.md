Hello everyone, this is Hua Zhao.
In these project, I have updated the main/py file as what instructor ask us to do.
I found out they are all very basic skills that we need to learn before we start coding our projects.
In the main.py file, it contains basic calculating method in Python. And introduce to you different type of data.
Also, small knowledge about random and loop. We also can use if function to find out if a number or a world is in the list or not.
Hope you can learn a lot about it from the file.
